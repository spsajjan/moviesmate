What Is a Plot?
The plot of a book, film, or play is the series of events that unfolds from start to finish. The plot explains not just what happens but also the causality—how one event leads to another.
Basic form of a plot contains three parts: a beginning, middle, and end.
A plot should advance with events occurring in chronological order.
plot is supported by additional components: exposition (beginning), rising action, climax (middle), falling action, and resolution (end).

What Is a Story?
A story is a complete narrative. It contains the plot, as well as also other literary devices such as character development, settings, and themes. A story includes the point of view, which is the perspective from which the story unfolds: Who is telling the story? Is it from the point of view of one of the characters? Is it from the point of view of an omniscient narrator? A story may also include a lesson or philosophy. A good story helps the reader feel emotion and care about the action. A short story usually has a single plot, but a novel or series may contain multiple plots or subplots. Having a great story is the bedrock of successful fiction writing, whether you’re screenwriting, developing a novel, or hosting a podcast.

Plot vs. Story: What’s the Difference?
A plot is the sequence of events within a story: a description of what happens and why it happens. A story is a comprehensive narrative. Plot is a part of the story, but a story also includes settings, characters, themes, and other factors that influence how the events (or plot) are told. While a plot is chronological, a story may unfold nonsequentially, combining the action with sections that focus on character development, philosophy, or building atmosphere and setting.
